## CATEGORY 1: DARK MATTER EVIDENCE

### Image 7: Galaxy Rotation Curve

**What This Image Shows:**
A graph comparing predicted vs. observed rotation velocities of stars in a spiral galaxy.

**Detailed Explanation:**

**The Setup:**
- **X-axis**: Distance from galaxy center (in kiloparsecs)
- **Y-axis**: Rotation velocity (km/s)
- **Two curves plotted**:
  1. **Predicted curve (dashed line)** - Based on visible matter only
  2. **Observed curve (solid line)** - Actual measurements

**What We Expected (Predicted Curve):**
- Stars close to center: slow rotation
- Stars at middle distances: fast rotation (most mass here)
- Stars at edge: slow rotation (Keplerian decline, like planets around Sun)
- Should follow: v ∝ 1/√r (velocity decreases with distance)

**What We Actually See (Observed Curve):**
- Stars close to center: slow rotation ✓
- Stars at middle distances: fast rotation ✓
- **Stars at edge: STILL FAST!** (flat rotation curve)
- Velocity stays constant, doesn't decrease

**The Problem:**
If only visible matter existed, outer stars should move slower (like outer planets). But they don't!

**The Solution: DARK MATTER**
- Invisible matter extends far beyond visible galaxy
- Forms a large "halo" around galaxy
- Provides extra gravitational pull
- Keeps outer stars moving fast
- **Proves dark matter exists!**

**Key Numbers:**
- Typical galaxy: visible radius ~15 kpc, dark matter halo ~100+ kpc
- Rotation velocity: ~200-250 km/s (stays flat)
- Dark matter mass: 5-10× visible matter mass

**Historical Note:**
- Discovered by Vera Rubin in 1970s
- Studied galaxy NGC 3198 and many others
- Revolutionized astronomy
- Rubin deserved Nobel Prize (never received it before death)

**For Your Poster:**
"Galaxy rotation curves show stars at galaxy edges moving faster than expected. This proves invisible dark matter surrounds galaxies in massive halos."

**What This Image Shows:**
A 3D visualization of a spiral galaxy surrounded by its invisible dark matter halo.

**Visual Elements:**

**Center: Spiral Galaxy (Orange/Yellow)**
- Visible stars and gas
- Spiral arms clearly visible
- Bright galactic bulge
- Diameter: ~30 kpc (100,000 light-years)

**Surrounding: Dark Matter Halo (Blue, semi-transparent)**

**2. Galaxy Formation:**
- Dark matter collapsed first
- Created gravitational wells
- Normal matter fell into wells
- Formed galaxies

**3. Galaxy Clusters:**
- Multiple galaxies in shared dark matter halo
- Halo holds cluster together
- Prevents galaxies from flying apart

**Simulation vs Reality:**
- This visualization from computer simulations
- Based on gravitational physics
- Matches observational data
- Confirmed by lensing studies

**For Your Poster:**
"Dark matter forms massive halos around galaxies, extending 10 times farther than visible stars. This invisible scaffolding holds galaxies together."

### Image 10: Weak Gravitational Lensing Grid

**What This Image Shows:**
A grid of background galaxies showing subtle shape distortions caused by foreground dark matter.

**The Setup:**

**Background: Grid of Galaxies**
- Hundreds of small, distant galaxies
- Arranged in regular grid pattern
- Each galaxy originally circular/elliptical
- Located billions of light-years away

**Foreground: Massive Cluster (Invisible)**
- Large galaxy cluster in front
- Contains dark matter
- Creates gravitational field
- Bends space-time

**The Effect: Systematic Distortions**
- Galaxies near cluster center: stretched radially
- Galaxies to sides: stretched tangentially
- Pattern points toward mass concentration
- Distortions subtle (~1-10% elongation)

**How It Works:**

**Step 1: Light Travels**
- Background galaxies emit light
- Light travels toward Earth
- Must pass near/through cluster

**Step 2: Space-Time Curvature**
- Cluster's gravity warps space-time
- Light follows curved paths
- Different parts of galaxy image take different paths

**Step 3: Image Distortion**
- Galaxy appears stretched
- Shape changed from circular to elliptical
- Orientation points toward/away from cluster
- Amount of stretch indicates mass

**Step 4: Statistical Analysis**
- Measure shapes of thousands of galaxies
- Average out random orientations
- Systematic pattern emerges
- **Reveals dark matter distribution!**

**Weak vs Strong Lensing:**

**Strong Lensing:**
- Very close to massive object
- Dramatic arcs, multiple images
- Easily visible by eye
- Rare

**Weak Lensing (This Image):**
- Farther from massive object
- Subtle shape changes
- Need statistics to detect
- Common, very useful

**What We Learn:**
- Total mass of cluster (including dark matter)
- Dark matter distribution map
- Confirms dark matter exists
- Independent of what matter is made of

**For Your Poster:**
"Weak gravitational lensing: Subtle distortions of background galaxies reveal the distribution of invisible dark matter in foreground clusters."

### Image 13: Hubble's Law Graph

**What This Image Shows:**
The graph that proves the universe is expanding - one of the most important discoveries in astronomy.

**The Graph:**

**X-axis: Distance (Megaparsecs)**
- Distance to galaxies
- 1 Megaparsec (Mpc) = 3.26 million light-years
- Range: 0 to ~500 Mpc
- Measured using:
  - Cepheid variables (nearby)
  - Type Ia supernovae (far)

**Y-axis: Recession Velocity (km/s)**
- How fast galaxy is moving away
- Measured using redshift: z = Δλ/λ
- Velocity = c × z (for small z)
- Range: 0 to ~35,000 km/s

**The Data Points:**
- Each point = one galaxy
- Scattered but clear trend
- Some scatter due to:
  - Measurement errors
  - Peculiar velocities (local motions)
  - Distance uncertainties

**The Line: Hubble's Law**
- **Equation**: v = H₀ × d
- **v** = recession velocity
- **H₀** = Hubble constant
- **d** = distance
- **Perfect linear relationship!**

**The Hubble Constant (H₀):**
- **Slope of the line**
- Current best value: ~70 km/s/Mpc
- Means: Galaxy 1 Mpc away recedes at 70 km/s
- Galaxy 2 Mpc away recedes at 140 km/s
- And so on...

**What This Means:**

**1. Universe is Expanding:**
- Farther galaxies move faster
- Not because they're "moving through space"
- Because space itself is expanding
- Carrying galaxies with it

**2. No Center:**
- Every galaxy sees same pattern
- No special location
- Universe expands uniformly everywhere
- Like dots on inflating balloon

**3. Universe Had a Beginning:**
- If expanding now, was smaller before
- Extrapolate backward → singularity
- **Age of universe**: 1/H₀ ≈ 13.8 billion years

**4. Redshift Explained:**
- Light waves stretched by expansion
- Longer wavelength = redder
- Amount of redshift ∝ distance
- **Cosmological redshift**, not Doppler

**Historical Context:**

**1929: Edwin Hubble's Discovery**
- Used 100-inch telescope at Mt. Wilson
- Measured 24 galaxies
- Found linear relationship
- Revolutionary!

**Before Hubble:**
- Universe thought to be static
- Einstein added cosmological constant to keep it static
- Called it his "biggest blunder" after Hubble's discovery

**Modern Measurements:**
- Hubble Space Telescope
- Thousands of galaxies
- Much more precise
- Confirms original discovery

**The Hubble Tension:**
- **Problem**: Different methods give different H₀
- CMB (early universe): ~67 km/s/Mpc
- Supernovae (late universe): ~73 km/s/Mpc
- **Discrepancy**: ~10% (statistically significant!)
- **Implication**: New physics? Systematic errors?
- Active area of research!

**For Your Poster:**
"Hubble's Law: Distant galaxies recede faster, proving the universe is expanding. This discovery revealed that the universe had a beginning 13.8 billion years ago."

**Why This Is Powerful Evidence:**

**1. No Other Explanation:**
- Stars can't make this ratio
- Stars make heavier elements, destroy lithium
- Only hot, dense early universe works

**2. Precise Predictions:**
- Theory made specific predictions
- Observations came decades later
- **Perfect match!**

**3. Independent Confirmation:**
- Different from CMB evidence
- Different from expansion evidence
- All point to same conclusion

**4. Sensitive to Conditions:**
- Abundances depend on:
  - Temperature history
  - Baryon density
  - Number of neutrino types
- Confirms our understanding

**The Physics:**

**T = 0 to 1 second:**
- Too hot for nuclei
- Protons and neutrons free
- Ratio: n/p ≈ 1/7 (from weak interactions)

**T = 1 to 180 seconds:**
- Cool enough for fusion
- Protons + neutrons → deuterium
- Deuterium + more → helium-4
- Some helium-3, lithium-7
- **Nucleosynthesis window!**

**T > 20 minutes:**
- Too cool for fusion
- Universe too dilute
- Abundances frozen
- No more element formation until stars

**For Your Poster:**
"Big Bang Nucleosynthesis predicted the exact abundances of light elements 75% hydrogen, 25% helium. Observations match perfectly, confirming the hot Big Bang."
