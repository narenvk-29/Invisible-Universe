## 🎬 Main Video Generation Prompt

```
Create an engaging, cinematic deep-dive into "The Invisible Universe" - exploring the cosmic mysteries of Black Holes, Dark Matter, and the Big Bang.

Structure the narrative as a journey through the cosmos:

**Opening Hook (30 seconds):**
Start with a mind-blowing fact: "95% of the universe is completely invisible to us. Everything we've ever seen - every star, planet, and galaxy - makes up just 5% of what's actually out there."

**Act 1: Black Holes - Cosmic Gravity Wells**
- Introduce black holes as regions where gravity is so extreme that nothing escapes
- Discuss the historic first image of M87's black hole by the Event Horizon Telescope
- Explain event horizons, singularities, and Hawking radiation
- Connect to how black holes shape galaxies

**Act 2: Dark Matter - The Invisible Scaffolding**
- Use the Bullet Cluster as the "smoking gun" evidence
- Explain how two galaxy clusters colliding revealed dark matter's existence
- Describe gravitational lensing - how we "see" the invisible
- Cover the candidates: WIMPs, Axions, Sterile Neutrinos
- Emphasize: 27% of the universe is this mysterious substance

**Act 3: The Big Bang - Our Cosmic Origin Story**
- Journey from 10^-43 seconds after the beginning to today
- Highlight key epochs: Planck Era, Inflation, Nucleosynthesis, Recombination
- Explain the Cosmic Microwave Background as the "baby picture" of the universe
- Use the Hubble Ultra Deep Field to show we're literally looking back in time

**Act 4: Galaxy Clusters - Laboratories of the Cosmos**
- Introduce Perseus Cluster and its X-ray revelations
- Explain how clusters reveal dark matter distribution
- Show how everything connects: black holes at centers, dark matter halos, hot gas

**Closing (Powerful ending):**
"We live in a universe where 95% of everything is invisible, where light itself cannot escape certain regions, and where the echoes of creation still whisper across the cosmos. The invisible universe isn't just around us - it IS us. And we're only beginning to understand it."

**Tone:** Awe-inspiring, scientifically accurate, accessible to general audience
**Style:** Like a premium documentary (think Cosmos or BBC Universe)
**Pacing:** Build wonder progressively, use dramatic pauses for key revelations
```

## 🎙️ Podcast-Style Audio Prompt

```
Generate a conversational deep-dive podcast about "The Invisible Universe" with two hosts discussing these mind-bending cosmic phenomena.

Topics to cover with enthusiasm and wonder:
1. The shocking revelation that 95% of the universe is invisible
2. Black holes - what they are, how we finally photographed one
3. The Bullet Cluster - the moment we proved dark matter exists
4. The Big Bang timeline - from nothing to everything in 13.8 billion years
5. How the Cosmic Microwave Background is literally ancient light from the universe's birth
6. Why this matters for understanding our place in the cosmos

Make it engaging, include "wow" moments, explain complex concepts simply, and maintain scientific accuracy while being entertaining.
