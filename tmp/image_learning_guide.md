# PART 1: DARK MATTER & THE BULLET CLUSTER

## Image 1: The Bullet Cluster Composite

![Bullet Cluster Composite](C:/Users/user/OneDrive/Documents/PhysicsPosterMaking2025/bullet_cluster_composite.jpg)

### What You're Looking At

This is one of the most important astronomical images ever taken. It's a **composite image** combining data from three different telescopes:

1. **Pink/Red clouds** = X-ray data from NASA's Chandra X-ray Observatory
2. **Blue regions** = Gravitational lensing mass map
3. **Orange/white dots and galaxies** = Optical light from Hubble Space Telescope and Magellan telescope

### Detailed Explanation of Each Component

#### The Pink Clouds (Hot Gas - Baryonic Matter)

**What it is:**
- Extremely hot gas between galaxies (intracluster medium)
- Temperature: ~17.4 keV (about 200 million degrees Celsius!)
- This gas emits X-rays, which is why Chandra can see it
- Contains most of the "normal" (baryonic) matter in these clusters

**The Bullet Shape (Right side):**
- The smaller pink clump on the right looks like a bullet moving through the larger cluster
- This is where the name "Bullet Cluster" comes from
- The bullet shape formed because the gas experienced **drag forces** during collision
- Like a bullet moving through air, it created a shock wave (the bow-shaped front)

**Why it lagged behind:**
- Gas particles have electromagnetic charge
- When two gas clouds collide, particles interact electromagnetically
- This creates friction/drag (similar to air resistance)
- The gas slowed down significantly during the collision

#### The Blue Regions (Dark Matter)

**What it is:**
- This is NOT direct observation of dark matter (we can't see it!)
- This is a **mass map** created using gravitational lensing
- Shows where the TOTAL MASS is located (including invisible dark matter)
- Created by analyzing how light from distant background galaxies is distorted

**Key observation:**
- The blue regions are clearly **separated** from the pink regions
- Blue is centered on the galaxy clusters (orange dots)
- This means most of the mass is NOT where the gas is!

**Why it didn't slow down:**
- Dark matter doesn't interact electromagnetically
- It only interacts through gravity
- During collision, dark matter passed right through without slowing
- No drag force, no friction, no interaction except gravity

#### The Orange/White Dots (Galaxies)

**What they are:**
- Individual galaxies within the clusters
- Each galaxy contains billions of stars
- Visible in optical light (what our eyes would see)

**Why they passed through:**
- Stars within galaxies are incredibly far apart
- Even during a "collision," individual stars almost never hit each other
- Galaxies passed through each other like two swarms of bees

### The Smoking Gun Evidence

**THE SEPARATION IS THE KEY:**

If dark matter didn't exist, the blue (mass) would be exactly where the pink (gas) is, because the gas is the most massive visible component. But they're separated!

This proves:
1. Most mass is NOT the visible gas
2. There's invisible matter (dark matter) that behaved differently
3. Dark matter only interacts gravitationally (no electromagnetic interaction)

**Why this is "direct" evidence:**
- We're directly observing the separation of dark and normal matter
- Not just inferring dark matter from galaxy rotation
- Actually seeing it behave differently in real-time (cosmologically speaking)

### Technical Details

- **Distance**: 3.8 billion light-years from Earth
- **Location**: Constellation Carina
- **Collision speed**: ~3,400 km/s (over 7.5 million mph!)
- **When collision occurred**: ~150 million years ago
- **Cluster masses**: Main cluster ~1.5 × 10¹⁵ solar masses, bullet ~1.5 × 10¹⁴ solar masses
- **Discovery**: 2006 (Clowe et al.)

## Image 2: Bullet Cluster Collision Sequence

![Collision Diagram](C:/Users/user/OneDrive/Documents/PhysicsPosterMaking2025/collision_diagram_dark.png)

### What You're Looking At

This diagram shows the **timeline** of the Bullet Cluster collision in three stages, illustrating how the three components (galaxies, gas, dark matter) behaved differently over time.

### Stage 1: BEFORE COLLISION (~500 million years ago)

**The Setup:**
- Two massive galaxy clusters approaching each other
- Each cluster contains:
  - **Galaxies** (orange) - collections of stars
  - **Hot gas** (pink) - intracluster medium
  - **Dark matter** (blue) - invisible halo surrounding everything

**Initial conditions:**
- Clusters moving toward each other at ~3,400 km/s
- All three components are together in each cluster
- About to undergo one of the most energetic events since the Big Bang

### Stage 2: DURING COLLISION (~150 million years ago)

**What's happening:**

**Galaxies (orange):**
- Passing through each other
- Stars are so far apart that collisions are extremely rare
- Essentially unaffected by the collision
- Continue moving at original velocity

**Hot Gas (pink):**
- Gas clouds colliding head-on
- Particles interacting electromagnetically
- Creating shock waves and heating up even more
- **Experiencing drag force** - slowing down significantly
- Like two clouds of smoke colliding

**Dark Matter (blue):**
- Passing through each other
- No electromagnetic interaction
- Only gravity affects it
- **No drag force** - maintains original velocity
- Like two ghost clouds passing through

### Stage 3: AFTER COLLISION (Today - what we observe)

**The Result:**

**Clear Separation:**
- **Gas (pink)** - lagged behind in the center, slowed by collision
- **Dark matter (blue)** - moved ahead with the galaxies
- **Galaxies (orange)** - continued through, now on opposite sides

**This is what the composite image shows us!**

The separation distance proves:
- Different physics governs each component
- Dark matter doesn't interact like normal matter
- Dark matter must be a real, distinct substance

### Timeline Summary

- **T = -500 million years**: Clusters approaching
- **T = -150 million years**: Peak collision, separation begins
- **T = 0 (today)**: Clear separation visible, what we observe now

### Physics Lesson

This diagram teaches us about **different fundamental interactions**:

1. **Gravitational interaction**: Affects all three components equally
2. **Electromagnetic interaction**: Only affects gas (charged particles)
3. **No interaction**: Dark matter doesn't feel electromagnetic forces

## Image 3: Gravitational Lensing Explained

![Gravitational Lensing Diagram](C:/Users/user/OneDrive/Documents/PhysicsPosterMaking2025/lensing_diagram_dark.png)

### What You're Looking At

This diagram explains **how we detect invisible dark matter** using gravitational lensing - one of the most important techniques in modern astronomy.

### The Setup (Left to Right)

#### 1. Background Galaxy (Far Left)

**What it is:**
- A distant galaxy billions of light-years behind the Bullet Cluster
- Emitting light in all directions
- Much farther away than the Bullet Cluster itself

**Why it's important:**
- Its light must pass near/through the Bullet Cluster to reach us
- Acts as a "test light source" to probe the mass distribution

#### 2. Dark Matter Mass (Center - Blue)

**What it is:**
- Massive concentration of dark matter in the Bullet Cluster
- Invisible to all telescopes
- But has enormous mass (10¹⁴ to 10¹⁵ solar masses)

**What it does:**
- Creates a strong gravitational field
- **Warps space-time** around it (Einstein's General Relativity)
- Acts like a lens, bending light that passes nearby

#### 3. Bent Light Paths (Yellow/Gold Curves)

**What's happening:**
- Light from background galaxy travels through curved space-time
- Instead of straight lines, light follows curved paths
- Multiple light rays take different curved paths
- Some rays are bent more than others

**The physics:**
- This is **gravitational lensing** - gravity bending light
- Predicted by Einstein in 1915
- Confirmed by observations in 1919
- Now used routinely to map dark matter

#### 4. Distorted Images (Near Observer)

**What we see:**
- Multiple distorted images of the background galaxy
- Stretched, arc-shaped images
- Sometimes magnified
- Sometimes multiple copies

**Why it's distorted:**
- Different light paths arrive at different angles
- Creates stretched, elongated images
- The amount of distortion tells us the mass of the lens

#### 5. Observer/Earth (Right)

**What we do:**
- Measure the shapes of many background galaxies
- Analyze the distortions statistically
- **Create a mass map** showing where mass is concentrated
- This reveals the dark matter distribution!

### How We Create the Blue Regions

**The Process:**

1. **Observe thousands of background galaxies** behind the Bullet Cluster
2. **Measure their shapes** - are they stretched? In what direction?
3. **Compare to expected shapes** - how much distortion?
4. **Calculate mass distribution** - what mass would cause this distortion?
5. **Create mass map** - the blue regions in the composite image!

### Two Types of Lensing

**Strong Lensing:**
- Very close to massive object
- Creates dramatic arcs, multiple images
- Easily visible by eye

**Weak Lensing:**
- Farther from massive object
- Subtle shape distortions
- Need statistical analysis of many galaxies
- This is what was used for the Bullet Cluster blue map

### Why This Is Powerful

**Direct mass measurement:**
- Doesn't depend on what the matter is made of
- Doesn't require the matter to emit light
- Works for ANY mass (visible or invisible)
- Independent confirmation of dark matter

**The Bullet Cluster result:**
- Mass map (blue) doesn't match gas distribution (pink)
- Most mass is invisible
- Located where dark matter should be
- Proves dark matter is real!

### Mathematical Note

The amount of bending depends on:
- **Mass of the lens** (more mass = more bending)
- **Distance** to background source
- **Alignment** of source, lens, and observer

Formula (simplified): deflection angle ∝ (4GM)/(c²b)
- G = gravitational constant
- M = mass of lens
- c = speed of light
- b = impact parameter (closest approach distance)

## Image 4: Dark Matter Evidence Infographic

![Dark Matter Evidence](C:/Users/user/OneDrive/Documents/PhysicsPosterMaking2025/dark_matter_infographic.png)

### What You're Looking At

This infographic summarizes **why the Bullet Cluster proves dark matter exists** by showing how three different components behaved during the collision.

### The Three Columns - Three Components

#### Column 1: GALAXIES (Orange Stars)

**What they are:**
- Collections of billions of stars
- Held together by gravity
- Visible in optical light

**How they behaved:**
- ✓ **Passed through unaffected**
- No collisions between individual stars
- Continued at original velocity
- Now on opposite sides of collision site

**The physics:**
- **Gravity only** - no other interactions
- Stars are too far apart to collide (even in a "collision")
- Average distance between stars: ~4 light-years
- Probability of star collision: nearly zero

**What this tells us:**
- Galaxies are mostly empty space
- Stellar collisions are extremely rare
- Gravity is the dominant force at galactic scales

#### Column 2: HOT GAS (Pink Cloud)

**What it is:**
- Ionized hydrogen and helium
- Temperature: ~200 million degrees Celsius
- Most of the baryonic (normal) matter
- Emits X-rays

**How it behaved:**
- ✗ **Slowed down by collision**
- Experienced drag force
- Lagged behind the galaxies
- Created shock waves and bullet shape

**The physics:**
- **Electromagnetic interaction** - particles have charge
- Gas particles collide and interact
- Creates friction/drag (like air resistance)
- Converts kinetic energy to heat
- Slows down the gas clouds

**What this tells us:**
- Normal matter interacts electromagnetically
- Collisions create observable effects (shock waves, heating)
- Gas contains most of the visible mass
- But NOT most of the total mass!

#### Column 3: DARK MATTER (Blue Halo)

**What it is:**
- Unknown particles
- Invisible to all electromagnetic radiation
- Makes up ~27% of universe
- Only interacts via gravity

**How it behaved:**
- ✓ **Passed through unimpeded**
- No drag force
- No slowing down
- Moved ahead with galaxies
- Now separated from gas

**The physics:**
- **Gravity only** - no electromagnetic interaction
- No collisions with itself or normal matter
- "Collisionless" dark matter
- Maintains original velocity

**What this tells us:**
- Dark matter doesn't interact electromagnetically
- It's fundamentally different from normal matter
- It's the dominant form of matter (by mass)
- It must be a new type of particle

### Before and After Comparison

**BEFORE COLLISION:**
- All three components together
- Gas, galaxies, and dark matter in same location
- Indistinguishable in terms of position

**AFTER COLLISION:**
- Clear separation visible
- Gas (pink) in center - slowed down
- Dark matter (blue) ahead - didn't slow down
- Galaxies (orange) with dark matter

### The Logical Proof

**If dark matter didn't exist:**
1. The gas would be the most massive component
2. The mass (blue) would be where the gas (pink) is
3. We would NOT see separation

**But we DO see separation, therefore:**
1. Most mass is NOT the gas
2. There's invisible matter that didn't slow down
3. This invisible matter = dark matter
4. Dark matter is REAL and DISTINCT from normal matter

### Why Alternative Theories Fail

**Modified Gravity Theories (like MOND):**
- Propose changing gravity laws instead of adding dark matter
- Cannot explain the separation
- If gravity is just stronger, gas would still have most mass
- Separation requires two different types of matter
- **Bullet Cluster rules out most alternative theories!**

### Composition of the Universe

Based on Bullet Cluster and other evidence:
- **68%** - Dark Energy (accelerates expansion)
- **27%** - Dark Matter (invisible, gravity only)
- **5%** - Normal Matter (atoms, stars, planets, us)

**We are made of the rarest stuff in the universe!**

# PART 2: THE BIG BANG & COSMIC EVOLUTION

## Image 5: Big Bang Timeline

![Big Bang Timeline](C:/Users/user/OneDrive/Documents/PhysicsPosterMaking2025/bigbang_timeline_dark.png)

### What You're Looking At

This timeline diagram shows the **complete evolution of the universe** from the Big Bang to present day, spanning 13.8 billion years. The expanding cone shape represents the universe getting larger over time, and the color gradient shows temperature cooling from red-hot to blue-cold.

### Detailed Timeline - Every Major Event

#### T = 0: THE SINGULARITY

**What it was:**
- Infinitely hot, infinitely dense point
- All of space, time, matter, and energy originated here
- Temperature: undefined (over 10³² K)
- Size: infinitesimally small

**What we DON'T know:**
- What caused it
- What came "before" (time itself started here)
- The physics at this instant (need quantum gravity theory)

**What we DO know:**
- This is when the universe began
- All evidence points back to this moment
- Not an explosion IN space, but expansion OF space itself

#### T = 10⁻⁴³ seconds: PLANCK TIME

**The earliest moment physics can describe:**
- Temperature: ~10³² K
- Planck time = smallest meaningful time unit
- Before this: quantum effects dominate, current physics breaks down
- All four fundamental forces unified

**The four forces:**
1. Gravity
2. Electromagnetic force
3. Strong nuclear force
4. Weak nuclear force

At this temperature, all were one "superforce"

#### T = 10⁻³⁶ to 10⁻³² seconds: COSMIC INFLATION

**The most dramatic event:**
- Universe expanded exponentially
- Grew by factor of 10²⁶ or more
- Faster than light (space itself expanding, not matter moving)
- Lasted tiny fraction of a second

**Why it happened:**
- Triggered by separation of strong nuclear force
- Released enormous energy
- Drove exponential expansion

**What it accomplished:**
- Smoothed out irregularities (universe became uniform)
- Explained why universe looks same in all directions
- Created tiny quantum fluctuations that became galaxies

**Evidence:**
- Uniformity of CMB
- Flatness of universe
- Patterns in CMB match inflation predictions

#### T = 10⁻¹² to 10⁻⁶ seconds: QUARK EPOCH

**Temperature: 10¹⁵ to 10¹² K**

**What existed:**
- Quark-gluon plasma
- Quarks (building blocks of protons/neutrons)
- Gluons (carriers of strong force)
- Leptons (electrons, neutrinos)
- Photons (light particles)

**What happened:**
- Too hot for protons/neutrons to form
- Matter and antimatter in equilibrium
- Continuous creation and annihilation

#### T = 10⁻⁶ seconds: HADRON EPOCH BEGINS

**Temperature: ~10¹² K (trillion degrees)**

**Critical transition:**
- Cool enough for quarks to combine
- Protons and neutrons form (hadrons)
- Matter-antimatter annihilation
- Slight excess of matter survives (1 in billion)

**Why we exist:**
- If matter and antimatter were exactly equal, they'd annihilate completely
- Tiny asymmetry left matter behind
- This matter became everything we see today
- **Mystery: Why was there asymmetry?**

#### T = 1 second: LEPTON EPOCH

**Temperature: 10¹⁰ K (10 billion degrees)**

**What existed:**
- Protons, neutrons, electrons, neutrinos, photons
- Still too hot for atoms
- Neutrinos decouple (stop interacting)

**The neutrino background:**
- Like CMB, but neutrinos instead of photons
- Still exists today, but never detected (too weak)
- Would tell us about universe at 1 second old!

#### T = 3 to 20 minutes: BIG BANG NUCLEOSYNTHESIS

**Temperature: 10⁹ K (billion degrees)**

**THE FIRST ATOMS FORM:**

This is one of the most important epochs!

**What happened:**
- Protons and neutrons combine
- Form nuclei of light elements
- **Hydrogen** (just a proton): 75% by mass
- **Helium-4** (2 protons, 2 neutrons): 25% by mass
- **Deuterium** (heavy hydrogen): 0.01%
- **Helium-3**: trace amounts
- **Lithium-7**: trace amounts

**Why it stopped:**
- Universe cooled below fusion temperature
- Expansion spread particles too far apart
- No heavier elements formed (need stars for that)

**Why this is evidence for Big Bang:**
- Theory predicts exact ratios: 75% H, 25% He
- Observations match predictions perfectly!
- No other process can explain these abundances
- **This is a pillar of Big Bang theory**

#### T = 10 seconds to 380,000 years: PHOTON EPOCH

**Temperature: 10¹⁰ K → 3,000 K**

**The "Dark Ages" begin:**
- Universe dominated by radiation (photons)
- Still too hot for atoms
- Electrons free, not bound to nuclei
- Universe opaque (like fog)

**Why opaque:**
- Free electrons scatter photons
- Light can't travel far
- Like trying to see through clouds
- Universe is glowing plasma

#### T = 380,000 years: RECOMBINATION / DECOUPLING

**Temperature: 3,000 K (about as hot as Sun's surface)**

**THE UNIVERSE BECOMES TRANSPARENT:**

This is the most important moment for observational cosmology!

**What happened:**
- Cool enough for electrons to combine with nuclei
- Neutral atoms form (mostly hydrogen)
- Photons stop scattering off electrons
- **Universe becomes transparent for first time!**

**The Cosmic Microwave Background is born:**
- Photons released at this moment
- Have been traveling freely ever since
- Stretched by universe expansion
- Now observed as microwave radiation at 2.7 K
- **This is what Planck satellite detected!**

**Why this is crucial:**
- Oldest light we can observe
- Snapshot of universe at 380,000 years
- Before this: universe opaque, can't see earlier
- This is our "cosmic horizon"

#### T = 380,000 to 400 million years: COSMIC DARK AGES

**Temperature: 3,000 K → ~100 K**

**A dark, quiet time:**
- No stars yet
- Only neutral hydrogen gas
- No light sources
- Universe truly dark
- Gravity slowly pulling gas together

**What's happening:**
- Tiny density variations from inflation
- Gravity amplifying these variations
- Denser regions getting denser
- Seeds of future galaxies forming

#### T = 400 million years: FIRST STARS IGNITE

**Temperature: ~100 K (background), millions K (in stars)**

**LET THERE BE LIGHT:**

**Population III stars:**
- First stars in universe
- Made only of hydrogen and helium (no heavy elements)
- Massive (100-1000 solar masses)
- Very hot and bright
- Short-lived (few million years)

**What they did:**
- Reionized the universe (split atoms back into ions)
- Created first heavy elements (carbon, oxygen, etc.)
- Ended the dark ages
- Seeded future generations of stars

#### T = 1 billion years: FIRST GALAXIES

**Temperature: ~20 K (background)**

**Structure emerges:**
- Stars cluster into galaxies
- Galaxies merge and grow
- Dark matter halos guide formation
- Large-scale structure begins

**The cosmic web:**
- Galaxies form along filaments
- Voids between filaments
- Clusters at intersections
- Pattern we see today

#### T = 9 billion years: DARK ENERGY DOMINATES

**Temperature: ~6 K**

**Expansion accelerates:**
- Dark energy becomes dominant force
- Universe expansion speeds up
- Discovered in 1998 (Nobel Prize 2011)
- Still mysterious!

**What is dark energy?**
- Unknown!
- Makes up 68% of universe
- Causes accelerating expansion
- Possibly vacuum energy
- Biggest mystery in physics

#### T = 9.3 billion years: OUR SOLAR SYSTEM FORMS

**Temperature: ~4 K**

**Getting closer to home:**
- Sun forms from gas cloud
- Planets condense from disk
- Earth forms 4.54 billion years ago
- Life begins ~3.8 billion years ago

#### T = 13.8 billion years: TODAY

**Temperature: 2.725 K**

**Present day:**
- Mature universe
- Billions of galaxies
- Stars, planets, life
- Still expanding
- Still cooling

**Current state:**
- 68% dark energy
- 27% dark matter
- 5% normal matter
- Accelerating expansion
- Ultimate fate: unknown

### Temperature Evolution Summary

The universe has cooled dramatically:
- **T = 0**: Over 10³² K
- **T = 3 min**: 10⁹ K (billion degrees)
- **T = 380,000 yr**: 3,000 K
- **T = today**: 2.7 K

**That's a factor of over 10²⁹ cooling!**

### The Expanding Cone

**Why cone-shaped:**
- Represents universe getting bigger
- Narrow at beginning (small universe)
- Wide at end (large universe)
- Still expanding today!

**Color gradient:**
- Red/orange = hot early universe
- Transition through yellow
- Blue/purple = cool late universe
- Represents temperature decrease

## Image 6: Planck CMB Map

![Planck CMB Map](C:/Users/user/OneDrive/Documents/PhysicsPosterMaking2025/cmb_planck_map.png)

### What You're Looking At

This is the **most detailed map ever made of the oldest light in the universe** - the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) radiation. Created by ESA's Planck satellite (2009-2013), this image shows the entire sky as it appeared when the universe was only 380,000 years old.

### Understanding the Image

#### The Shape

**Why it's oval:**
- This is the entire sky projected onto a flat surface
- Like a world map showing Earth's sphere on flat paper
- Every point represents a direction in space
- Covers full 360° around us

**What we're seeing:**
- Looking in all directions from Earth
- Each point is ~13.8 billion light-years away
- The "surface" of the observable universe
- Our cosmic horizon

#### The Colors - Temperature Variations

**The Temperature Scale:**

**Average temperature: 2.725 K everywhere**

But there are tiny variations:
- **Red/Orange regions**: Slightly warmer (+0.0002 K)
- **Blue/Purple regions**: Slightly cooler (-0.0002 K)
- **Total variation**: Only 1 part in 100,000!

**Why so uniform?**
- Cosmic inflation smoothed everything out
- Universe was in thermal equilibrium
- Same temperature everywhere (almost)

**Why ANY variation?**
- Quantum fluctuations during inflation
- Amplified to cosmic scales
- These became seeds of structure
- Without them: no galaxies, no stars, no us!

### What the Variations Mean

#### Hot Spots (Red/Orange)

**What they represent:**
- Slightly denser regions at 380,000 years
- More matter concentrated there
- Stronger gravitational pull
- Future galaxy clusters

**What happened to them:**
- Gravity pulled in more matter
- Grew over billions of years
- Became galaxy clusters
- Where most galaxies are today

#### Cold Spots (Blue/Purple)

**What they represent:**
- Slightly less dense regions
- Less matter
- Weaker gravitational pull
- Future voids

**What happened to them:**
- Matter drained away to denser regions
- Became cosmic voids
- Empty regions between galaxy clusters
- Where few galaxies exist today

### The Physics Behind CMB

#### How It Was Created

**At T = 380,000 years:**

1. **Before recombination:**
   - Universe filled with hot plasma
   - Free electrons everywhere
   - Photons constantly scattering
   - Universe opaque (like fog)

2. **Recombination occurs:**
   - Temperature drops to 3,000 K
   - Electrons combine with protons
   - Neutral hydrogen atoms form
   - Photons stop scattering

3. **Photons released:**
   - Travel freely for first time
   - Stream in all directions
   - Begin 13.8 billion year journey
   - Arrive at Earth today as CMB

#### Why It's Microwave Radiation

**Cosmological redshift:**

**Originally:**
- Photons emitted at 3,000 K
- Visible/infrared light
- Orange-red glow

**After 13.8 billion years:**
- Universe expanded by factor of ~1,100
- Wavelengths stretched by same factor
- 3,000 K → 2.7 K
- Visible light → microwaves

**The math:**
- Original wavelength × expansion factor = current wavelength
- Original temperature / expansion factor = current temperature
- 3,000 K / 1,100 ≈ 2.7 K ✓

### What We Learn From CMB

# PART 3: CONNECTING THE INVISIBLE UNIVERSE

## How All Images Tell One Story

### The Big Picture: 95% Invisible

Both the Bullet Cluster and Big Bang/CMB reveal that **most of the universe is invisible** to our eyes and traditional telescopes.

#### From Bullet Cluster We Learn:

**27% of universe is DARK MATTER**
- Invisible matter
- Only interacts via gravity
- Detected through gravitational lensing
- Separated from normal matter in collisions
- Essential for galaxy formation

#### From Big Bang/CMB We Learn:

**68% of universe is DARK ENERGY**
- Invisible energy
- Causes accelerating expansion
- Detected through distant supernovae and CMB
- Dominates universe today
- Mysterious and unexplained

**Early universe was invisible**
- Before stars: dark ages
- Before recombination: opaque plasma
- CMB: invisible microwave radiation
- Can only see back to 380,000 years

#### Only 5% is Normal Matter

**What we're made of is the rarest stuff!**
- Stars, planets, gas, dust
- Atoms (protons, neutrons, electrons)
- Everything we can see
- Only tiny fraction of universe

### Detection Methods - Seeing the Invisible

#### 1. Gravitational Lensing (Dark Matter)
- Mass bends light
- Measure distortions
- Map invisible mass
- **Bullet Cluster blue regions**

#### 2. X-ray Observations (Hot Gas)
- Hot gas emits X-rays
- Invisible to eyes
- Chandra telescope detects it
- **Bullet Cluster pink regions**

#### 3. Microwave Telescopes (CMB)
- Detect microwave radiation
- Invisible to eyes
- Planck satellite maps it
- **CMB map**

#### 4. Redshift Measurements (Expansion)
- Light stretched by expansion
- Measure wavelength shift
- Determine recession velocity
- **Proves universe expanding**

### Timeline of Discovery

# STUDY GUIDE

## Key Numbers to Memorize

### Bullet Cluster
- **Distance**: 3.8 billion light-years
- **Collision speed**: 3,400 km/s
- **Time since collision**: 150 million years
- **Discovery year**: 2006

### Big Bang
- **Age of universe**: 13.8 billion years
- **CMB released**: 380,000 years after Big Bang
- **CMB temperature**: 2.725 K
- **Original temperature**: 3,000 K (at recombination)
- **Nucleosynthesis**: 3 minutes after Big Bang

### Universe Composition
- **Dark energy**: 68%
- **Dark matter**: 27%
- **Normal matter**: 5%

## Key Concepts to Understand

### 1. Why Bullet Cluster Proves Dark Matter
- Three components behaved differently
- Gas slowed down (electromagnetic interaction)
- Dark matter didn't slow down (gravity only)
- Separation proves dark matter is real and distinct

### 2. How Gravitational Lensing Works
- Mass bends space-time
- Light follows curved paths
- Creates distorted images
- Reveals invisible mass distribution

### 3. What CMB Is
- Radiation from 380,000 years after Big Bang
- Oldest light we can observe
- Cooled from 3,000 K to 2.7 K
- Proves Big Bang theory

### 4. Why Universe Is 95% Invisible
- Dark matter: 27% (invisible, gravity only)
- Dark energy: 68% (invisible, accelerates expansion)
- Normal matter: only 5%

## Explaining to Others

### Elevator Pitch (30 seconds)
"95% of the universe is invisible. The Bullet Cluster shows us dark matter - invisible matter that only interacts through gravity - by capturing two galaxy clusters colliding. The cosmic microwave background is invisible radiation from the Big Bang, showing us the universe at 380,000 years old. Together, they reveal the hidden cosmos."

### Detailed Explanation (5 minutes)

**Start with the big picture:**
"Most of the universe is invisible to our eyes. Only 5% is normal matter - stars, planets, us. The other 95% is dark matter and dark energy."

**Explain Bullet Cluster:**
"The Bullet Cluster is two galaxy clusters that collided. When they hit, the gas slowed down but the dark matter passed right through. We can see this separation in the image - pink is gas, blue is dark matter. This proves dark matter is real."

**Explain CMB:**
"The Cosmic Microwave Background is radiation from when the universe was 380,000 years old. It's the oldest light we can see. It's invisible to our eyes because it's microwave radiation, but satellites like Planck can detect it."

**Connect them:**
"Both discoveries reveal the invisible universe. The Bullet Cluster shows us invisible matter. The CMB shows us invisible radiation from the early universe. Together, they prove that what we see is just a tiny fraction of what exists."
