- Not found yet...

🔵 **Axions**
- Ultra-light particles
- 1 billion× lighter than electron!

- Uncertain...

**Q: How do we know it exists?**
A: Multiple proofs! ✓✓✓
   → Galaxy rotation

## Paper 7: BRIGHT CORAL/SALMON PAPER

### Title (Top, Green Marker, Large)
**"Hubble's Law - Universe Expansion"**

### Content (Black Pen, Graph + Explanation)

**The Discovery (1929):**
[Draw simple graph]
    ↑ Speed
    |     •    •    •
    |   •   •   •
    | •  •  •
    |____________→ Distance

**The Law:**
v = H₀ × d

where:
- v = recession velocity
- d = distance to galaxy
- H₀ = Hubble constant (~70 km/s/Mpc)

**What It Means:**
✓ Universe is EXPANDING
✓ Farther = faster recession
✓ No center → everywhere expands
✓ Had a beginning (Big Bang!)

**Cosmic Time Machine:**
Light takes time to travel
→ Farther = older
→ We see the PAST!

[Draw telescope icon]
Looking far = looking back in time

**Age of Universe:**
Age ≈ 1/H₀
≈ 13.8 billion years
[Draw birthday cake with candles]

### Bottom Fact (Circle it, add stars)
"Space itself expands - galaxies aren't moving THROUGH space, they're carried BY space!" ⭐

**What Formed:**
[Draw simple bar chart]

Hydrogen    ████████████████ 75%
            (most abundant)

Helium-4    ████████ 25%
            (second place)

Deuterium   █ 0.01%
            (heavy hydrogen)

Helium-3    ▌ trace
Lithium-7   ▌ trace

**WHY THIS IS AMAZING:**

1️⃣ Theory PREDICTED these ratios (1940s-50s)

2️⃣ Observations MATCHED perfectly! (1990s-2000s)

3️⃣ Only hot Big Bang explains this

4️⃣ Stars can't make these ratios

**The Test:**
✓ 75% H everywhere? YES!
✓ 25% He everywhere? YES!
✓ Trace D, He-3, Li-7? YES!

╔══════════════════════════╗
║ This is SMOKING GUN      ║
║ proof the universe was   ║
║ once incredibly hot &    ║
║ dense, exactly as Big    ║
║ Bang theory predicts! 🎯 ║
